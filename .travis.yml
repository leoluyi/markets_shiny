  # You may want to update this to whatever the latest version is, or keep it
  # the same as your local machines. However, I have only tested it with 1.8.0+.
  # There should be a time in the future when this is not necessary - it is
  # explained in more detail below.
  DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION: 1.23.2

sudo: required
language: generic

services:
  - docker

before_install:
  # update is required to update the repositories to see the new packages for
  # Docker.
  - sudo apt update -y

  # Now we can install the newer docker-engine which is required for the newer
  # docker-composer we will install next. The messy options are to force it to
  # be non-interactive (normally it asks you a bunch of config questions).
  - sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io
  - sudo apt install --only-upgrade -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold" -y docker-ce

  # Print out the current docker-compose version. Once this reports 1.6+ then we
  # do not need the following steps.
  - docker version
  - docker-compose --version

  # As of the writing of this script Travis has docker-compose v1.4.2, we need
  # to update it to 1.8+. $DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION is provide from the `env`
  # above.
  - sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  - curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > docker-compose
  - chmod +x docker-compose
  - sudo mv docker-compose /usr/local/bin

  # Check that docker-compose is now running the latest version (or at least the
  # one we specified). This is not to be confused with the version we printed
  # before doing the update.
  - docker-compose --version
  - docker-compose up -d
  - docker ps

script:
  - docker-compose exec app bash -c "cd /srv/shiny-server/app && Rscript run_tests.R"

after_success:
  - docker-compose down
  - docker login -u leoluyi -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD
  - docker tag leoluyi/shiny:latest leoluyi/shiny:$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER
